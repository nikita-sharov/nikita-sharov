> When applying for this role please include a link to a brief portfolio showing a few selected commercial projects you worked on in the past â€” clearly outlining the problems and/or business opportunities taken on with your work, as well as your role and specific responsibilities as part of a multidisciplinary team. That should mostly touch on the process applied to find solutions and overcome challenges, rather than focusing just on visual polish and final deliverables.
